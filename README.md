# Quiz System (C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **console-based Quiz System developed in C++** as a programming project.  
The system allows an authorized user to **create a quiz**, and users can **take the quiz**, view their **score**, or **delete the quiz**.

The project is designed using **basic C++ concepts**, making it suitable for beginners and first-semester students.
